        <h2><u>Graduation</u></h2>
        <blockquote>
        	I pursuing my B-tech from<a href="https://www.cgc.edu.in/">Chandigarh Group of Colleges,Landran Mohali.</a>When I was deciding which engineering college to join, I was confused between CGC landran,Techo India salt lake,Kolkata and Netaji Subhas Chandra bose college,Kolkata. Due to many factors like fees, distance from my residence, placements and Environment etc. I finally chose CGC landran.First day in the college I got to know that there many students who are in CSE department, around 300 in COE. But my friends from Techno India Salt Lake,Kolkata told me that they also have similar strength.The good thing I have felt about this college is that it provides me ample opportunities for one’s growth whether it is related to academics or industrial exposure or to build up myself soft skills and self confidence which all will help me in getting placed.

        <blockquote>
    <strong>Location:</strong> It is situated at the edge of the main city, in Mohali. Chandigarh is a 10–15 minute ride away. Areas like, Kharar, Banur, are close by. So yes, the location is good and well connected with the main city. The city itself is pretty cool too. I mean, C’mon. It’s Chandigarh.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   <strong>Academics:</strong> The teachers may/may not be really highly qualified. However, they do try their best and work hard to make the students understand the concepts. If you have a good idea for a project in your head, let the HoD know. They’ll fund you, it’s not even hard to convince them. The college management is always waiting for a research project which might have a chance of getting patented. Not a single teacher I’ve met here is a pain. Not one. Which should be a relief considering the curriculum. I can’t say the same about the attendance though. 75% is the bare minimum for every fortnight, failing which, the class counselor is bound to call your parents and inform them. Take care of the attendance and you’ll be fine.   </blockquote>
<blockquote>
   <strong>Infrastructure:</strong>The management is continuously working on it. The labs are new with comparatively better equipment. The hostel is neat and the wifi is adequate. The wifi will obviously be slower during peak hours (100 kbps on idm) and blazing fast at odd hours (3–5 mbps, although I’ve witnessed 37 mbps at 0345 in the morning too).</blockquote>
<blockquote>
   <strong>Placements:</strong>A lot of companies visit the campus every placement season. From mass IT recruiters to the so-called core companies. These include, Deloitte, Wipro, Oracle, Cognizant, Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco, Tata Hitachi, HCL, IBM, etc. If you know stuff, you’ll get a badass package.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
   <strong>Campus:</strong>There are some really beautiful places in and around the campus. Take a walk in the evening and you’ll find people mostly playing football and cricket. The fast food outlets too are a boon. The campus is laced with water vending machines. There are some places where you will find literally no one around, so you can settle there if and when you wish to write a poem.
